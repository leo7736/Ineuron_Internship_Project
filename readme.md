# Expenditure Data Analysis Project


## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of expenditure data to derive valuable insights for informed decision-making. The dataset is processed and analyzed using various tools including MS Excel, Alteryx, Power BI, and Power BI Service.

## Tools Used

- **MS Excel:**
  Excel is utilized for initial data cleaning, basic analysis, and data preprocessing. It provides a familiar environment for cleaning and organizing data before more complex analysis.

- **Alteryx:**
  Alteryx is employed for advanced data cleansing, transformation, and integration. Its powerful ETL capabilities enable efficient preparation of data for in-depth analysis.

- **Power BI:**
  Power BI desktop is used for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards. It allows the creation of various charts, graphs, and visualizations to represent the data comprehensively.

- **Power BI Service:**
  Power BI Service is utilized for sharing and collaborating on the created dashboards. It allows the sharing of interactive reports with stakeholders and enables real-time collaboration.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection:**
   Obtain the expenditure dataset from the relevant source. Ensure it is in a structured format for further analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   Use MS Excel for initial data cleaning. Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format the data appropriately. Further cleaning and transformation are performed in Alteryx for more complex tasks.

3. **Data Integration:**
   Utilize Alteryx to integrate data from multiple sources if necessary. Merge datasets to create a unified view for analysis.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Power BI desktop. Create various visualizations to understand expenditure patterns, trends, and correlations.

5. **Dashboard Creation:**
   Design interactive dashboards using Power BI desktop. Include charts, graphs, and slicers to allow users to explore the data intuitively.

6. **Report Sharing and Collaboration:**
   Publish the created dashboard to Power BI Service. Share the report with stakeholders and team members. Enable collaboration and gather feedback for improvements.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop for further exploration and modification.
3. For data preprocessing and integration, open the Alteryx workflow and make necessary adjustments.
4. Run the workflow in Alteryx to obtain the cleaned and integrated dataset.
5. Use MS Excel for any additional data cleaning if required.
